Module: Mobile Development
E3: Application of Learning

Done the required coding for the module. To run it, clone the repo into Android Studio and run the "app" part. Running the tests should also pass.

Note: I am "YorkshireDev", did this on a different machine logged into my personal GitHub, but pushed it up to my AND GitHub!
